# Global Cloudmap Repo

This repo serves as a distribution point for near realtime and archive access to global cloudmaps you can use with xplanet (see  https://github.com/chron0/xfce-planet) or as blender textures. Full pull not recommended :)


## Usage

### Licence

Since we all paid for construction & launch of those birds with our tax
money the images belong to everyone. The actual creative work of stitching
the images together is done by software, which cannot claim anything
because it has no rights. Therefore you can do whatever you want with
these images.
